## üß† Project Objectives

This project simulates the end-to-end process followed by data analysts in real-world business environments:

- Design and create the inventory database schema  
- Load and clean a large inventory dataset  
- Perform structured EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  
- Derive actionable business insights using advanced SQL queries  
- Present metrics such as turnover ratio, stock-outs, and profitability

## üìÅ Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: **[Zepto Inventory Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)**  
It closely replicates a real-world e-commerce inventory system, scraped from Zepto's official product listings.

Each row represents a unique **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)** ‚Äî a granular view of individual products, including variations in weight, packaging, or discount schemes.

## üîß Step-by-Step Project Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Schema Creation

```sql
CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Import
Used pgAdmin 4‚Äôs import feature with UTF-8 encoding

Alternate method using SQL:

sql
Copy
Edit
\copy zepto(category,name,mrp,discountPercent,availableQuantity,
            discountedSellingPrice,weightInGms,outOfStock,quantity)
FROM 'data/zepto_v2.csv'
WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');
